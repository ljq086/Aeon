Aeon is simple client side library that I use on my projects. It predates jQuery and it originally contained many of the nuts and bolts that jQuery provides. At some point I removed all that and replaced it with jQuery, which is now a part of Aeon.

Aeon includes <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://linqjs.codeplex.com/">linqjs</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/igorfrance/Aeon">few of it's own utilities</a>. It also provides several useful prototype extensions on the built-in objects that, among other things, provide additional inheritance functionality on the Function object. For anyone offended by modified
built-in object prototypes, sorry about that, but that feature is too useful not to be used, in my opinion.
